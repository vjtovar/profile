## Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you! I'm Valerie, a Software Engineering student at nology.io.

## A Little About Me
 I am a full stack developer working to provide meaningful functionality to applications. I come from a Biotechnology background where I worked in a Cell Therapy laboratory, but I have pivoted into a career in tech. I wanted to challenge myself to learn a new set of skills. My background in Biotech will provide unique solutions to problems in the tech idustry. I am passionate about creating a better experience through understanding any given task and creating the optimal solution. I am eager to learn more and continue expanding the limits of my capabilities. I am constantly striving to improve my techniques, expand my skillset, and find new opportunities to grow.
